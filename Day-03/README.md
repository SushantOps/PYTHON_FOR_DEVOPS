## Introduction

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its simplicity and readability. In Python, keywords and variables are crucial building blocks that allow you to create and manage data effectively.

## Python Keywords

Python keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and functionalities within the language. These words cannot be used as variable names, as they are used to define the structure and flow of your Python code.

Some common Python keywords include:
- `if`
- `else`
- `for`
- `while`
- `def`
- `import`
- `return`
- `and`
- `or`
- `not`

In this tutorial, we'll explain the role and usage of these keywords in Python code.

## Python Variables

Variables in Python are used to store and manipulate data. Unlike keywords, you can choose variable names to represent various data types, values, and objects. Understanding how to work with variables is fundamental to writing Python programs.

We'll cover topics like:
- Variable naming conventions
- Data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, etc.)
- Variable assignment and reassignment

## Usage

To get started with this tutorial, simply clone the repository and open the `keywords_and_variables.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook or `keywords_and_variables.py` Python script.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keywords-and-variables-python.git
cd keywords-and-variables-python
```

Feel free to explore the code examples and explanations provided within the notebook or script.
