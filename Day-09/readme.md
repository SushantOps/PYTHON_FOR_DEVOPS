## Introduction to Loops

Loops are a fundamental programming concept that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly. In Python, loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing collections of data.

## Types of Loops

### 1. `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. It is commonly used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### 2. `while` Loop

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`. It is suitable when the number of iterations is unknown in advance.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1
```

## Loop Control Statements

Python provides control statements to modify the behavior of loops:

- `break`: Terminates the loop prematurely.
- `continue`: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next.
- `pass`: Acts as a placeholder to do nothing.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how loops can be used in Python:

```python
# Using a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum = 0
for num in numbers:
    sum += num
print("Sum:", sum)

# Using a while loop to find the factorial of a number
n = 5
factorial = 1
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
print("Factorial:", factorial)
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure your loop has a clear exit condition to prevent infinite loops.
- Keep the code inside the loop clean and organized.
- Use meaningful variable names to enhance code readability.

## Conclusion

Loops are a fundamental concept in Python, enabling you to repeat tasks and process data efficiently. Understanding when to use `for` and `while` loops, along with control statements, is crucial for effective programming. Happy coding! üöÄüêç
